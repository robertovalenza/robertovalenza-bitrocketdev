I'm Front End Javascript Developer with 5 months of experience in ReactJS development.

Since I was 14 years old I started producing music, and this helped me to be a creative person, at the age of 16 years old I wrote my first code in school and since that day I was amazed by programming, so I started buying online courses and books about HTML, CSS, Javascript and Design.

I studied in school languages like: C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP but I realized later that my career would be on Front End Development.

After graduation at technical institute I.T.I Vittorio Emanuele 3, I started the bootcamp in bitRocket.dev that helped me to learn new skills about Front End Development and where I now work and I'm constantly interested in improving my skills.


TECH SKILLS:

• HTML
• CSS
• JavaScript ES7
• TypeScript
• ReactJS
• NextJS
• Redux

I like working with Styled-Components Development and GitFlow.
