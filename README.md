# Roberto Valenza
I'm Front End Javascript Developer with 1+ year of experience.
Since I was 14 years old I started producing music, and this helped me to be a creative person, at the age of 16 years old I wrote my first code in school and since that day I was amazed by programming, so I started buying online courses and books about HTML, CSS, Javascript and Design.

I studied in school languages like: C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP but I realized later that my career would be on Front End Development.

TECH SKILLS:

• HTML
• CSS
• JavaScript ES7
• TypeScript
• ReactJS
• NextJS
• AngularJS
• Ionic
• RxJs

I like working with EmotionJS Development and GitFlow.
